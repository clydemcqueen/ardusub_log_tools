## Instructions for agents

There is a Python venv in the root directory, please use it.

Use pytest for testing.

Unless instructed otherwise, always support multiple log files, recursion and file globbing.

There are 2 templates, please use one of them if possible:
* tlog_template.py: for tools that just read files
* tlog_template_segments.py: for tools that support segments
